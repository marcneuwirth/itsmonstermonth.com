===================

It all started [here](http://www.drunkenfist.com/304/tag/monster-month/). 

For several years I (Rob Larsen) have been drawing a monster every day for the month of October. AKA *Monster Month*. Eventualy other people started to do it too. This year? I'm hoping to have a single site to share the goodness. This is that site. 

**If... we can pull it together in time. **
